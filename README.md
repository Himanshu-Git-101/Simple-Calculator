# How It Works

1. The program runs a continuous loop using "while True".
2. A menu is displayed showing six options.
3. The user selects an operation 1–6
4. The calculator asks for two numbers.
5. It performs the operation using "if-elif" conditions.
6. Result is displayed
7. The loop restarts unless the user chooses "Exit".
